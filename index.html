                <h2>Getting Around</h2>

                <p>One of the best things about the United Kingdom is that is has a great mode of public
                    transportation. For intercity travel, you can take the trains and enjoy the scenery
                    before getting off at your destination. For intracity travel, buses and subways are a
                    great option, although I found the places I wanted to visit close enough to each other
                    to simply spend an additional few minutes just walking around.
                </p>

                <p>That being said, my main method of transportation between the cities was by train.
                    Once I was in each city, I generally walked around; however, for slightly longer
                    distances or when I was too tired, I took the bus/subway.
                </p>

                <h4>Buses/Subways</h4>
                    
                <p>What makes the public transportation system so convenient and accessible is that it is
                    relatively easy to navigate with Google Maps. Additionally, all fares can be paid with
                    a <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/how-to-pay-and-where-to-buy-tickets-and-oyster/pay-as-you-go/contactless-and-mobile-pay-as-you-go">
                    contactless</a> card, so there is no need to purchase cards for transportation like the
                    Oyster card. Mobile payments are also a viable option, but I personally chose the card
                    method.
                </p>

                <p>For the buses, some cities just took a standard fare no matter how many stops you were
                    passing. In other areas, you have to tell the driver the exact stop name you plan on
                    getting off at so that they can charge you the appropriate amount. They will then print
                    out a paper ticket for you to take.
                </p>

                <p>While I think that this is the case for most bus systems nowadays, just in case you
                    aren't familiar with how to get off at your stop, be sure to press the "STOP" button
                    that can be found near your seat (usually on a vertical handrail or by the window). If
                    you do not press the button and no one else is getting off at your stop, the driver will
                    not stop (unless there are passengers wanting to get onto the bus). In other words, the
                    bus will only stop if the button has been pressed by you or another passenger.
                </p>

                <h4>Trains + Railcard</h4>
                
                <p>Let's move on to trains. While I was planning my trip, I came across various options for
                    travel by train. There were rail passes, railcards, and also the choice to simply purchase
                    the tickets individually (without any pass or card). I initially planned on purchasing a
                    rail pass since there were varying durations (3 days, 7 days, 10 days, etc) for how long
                    I could use the pass. As long I used the pass in its designated time frame, I could have
                    unlimited rides within the appropriate regions - there are passes such as Eurail (travel
                    throughout Europe) and BritRail (travel throughout the UK). However, based on the areas
                    that I wanted to tour, the passes did not seem like the best option.
                </p>

                <p>This now brings me to the railcard option. Depending on your travel situation, one of
                    these cards may apply to you and save you some money when purchasing train tickets. Since
                    I was travelling with one other person, I bought the Two Together Railcard (this railcard
                    requires that both people purchase the same train ticket). There are plenty of other cards
                    available such as those aged 16-25, family/friends traveling together, etc.
                </p>

                <p>You can make the purchase online and either get a physical railcard or a mobile one. For
                    the mobile card, you'll just have to download the Railcard app (there are instructions
                    in the follow-up email) and add the card information. When you go on to choose and
                    purchase your train tickets, be sure to indicate that you have a railcard so that the
                    discounts can apply.
                </p>

                <p>Once you are on the actual train, be sure to have your ticket and railcard ready. There
                    will be an employee that will ask each passenger for their ticket. If you have a railcard,
                    you will also present them with that.
                </p>

                <p>If a railcard does not apply to you, you may have to just buy the tickets at their listed
                    price unless there is another discount applicable.
                </p>

                <p>Tip: Look out for off-peak times on your ticket because you can save quite a bit of
                    money from there.
