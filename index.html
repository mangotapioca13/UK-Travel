        <p>If you're looking to spend around a week and a half in the United Kingdom,
            keep reading! We'll spend a few days in Scotland, Wales, and England
            (most of the time will be spent in a few cities throughout England) :D

        <h2>Getting Around</h2>

        <p>One of the best things about the United Kingdom is that is has a great mode of public
            transportation. For intercity travel, you can take the trains and enjoy the scenery
            before getting off at your destination. For intracity travel, buses and subways are a
            great option, although I found the places I wanted to visit close enough to each other
            to simply spend an additional few minutes just walking around.
        </p>

        <p>That being said, my main method of transportation between the cities was by train.
            Once I was in each city, I generally walked around; however, for slightly longer
            distances or when I was too tired, I took the bus/subway.
        </p>

        <h4>Buses/Subways</h4>
            
        <p>What makes the public transportation system so convenient and accessible is that it is
            relatively easy to navigate with Google Maps. Additionally, all fares can be paid with
            a contactless card, so there is no need to purchase cards for transportation like the
            Oyster card. Mobile payments are also a viable option, but I personally chose the card
            method.
        </p>

        <p>For the buses, some cities just took a standard fare no matter how many stops you were
            passing. In other areas, you have to tell the driver the exact stop name you plan on
            getting off at so that they can charge you the appropriate amount. They will then print
            out a paper ticket for you to take.
        </p>

        <p>While I think that this is the case for most bus systems nowadays, just in case you
            aren't familiar with how to get off at your stop, be sure to press the "STOP" button
            that can be found near your seat (usually on a vertical handrail or by the window). If
            you do not press the button and no one else is getting off at your stop, the driver will
            not stop (unless there are passengers wanting to get onto the bus). In other words, the
            bus will only stop if the button has been pressed by you or another passenger.
        </p>

        <h4>Trains + Railcard</h4>
        
        <p>Let's move on to trains. While I was planning my trip, I came across various options for
            travel by train. There were rail passes, railcards, and also the choice to simply purchase
            the tickets individually (without any pass or card). I initially planned on purchasing a
            rail pass since there were varying durations (3 days, 7 days, 10 days, etc) for how long
            I could use the pass. As long I used the pass in its designated time frame, I could have
            unlimited rides within the appropriate regions - there are passes such as Eurail (travel
            throughout Europe) and BritRail (travel throughout the UK). However, based on the areas
            that I wanted to tour, the passes did not seem like the best option.
        </p>

        <p>This now brings me to the railcard option. Depending on your travel situation, one of
            these cards may apply to you and save you some money when purchasing train tickets. Since
            I was travelling with one other person, I bought the Two Together Railcard (this railcard
            requires that both people purchase the same train ticket). There are plenty of other cards
            available such as those aged 16-25, family/friends traveling together, etc.
        </p>

        <p>You can make the purchase online and either get a physical railcard or a mobile one. For
            the mobile card, you'll just have to download the Railcard app (there are instructions
            in the follow-up email) and add the card information. When you go on to choose and
            purchase your train tickets, be sure to indicate that you have a railcard so that the
            discounts can apply.
        </p>

        <p>Once you are on the actual train, be sure to have your ticket and railcard ready. There
            will be an employee that will ask each passenger for their ticket. If you have a railcard,
            you will also present them with that.
        </p>

        <p>If a railcard does not apply to you, you may have to just buy the tickets at their listed
            price unless there is another discount applicable.
        </p>

        <p>Tip: Look out for off-peak times on your ticket because you can save quite a bit of
            money from there.
