        <p>If you're looking to spend a few days in the United Kingdom, keep reading!
            We'll spend a few days in Scotland, Wales, and England
            (most of the time will be spent in a few cities throughout England) :D

        <p>I took a flight to London Heathrow that landed early in the morning (around 7:30)
            so I opted to complete the bulk of heavy travelling in the first half of my trip.
            That being said, after I landed, I took a 4 hour train to Edingburgh, Scotland
            and worked my way from the northern parts of the UK back to London, England.
