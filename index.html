            keep reading! We'll spend a few days in Scotland, Wales, and England
            (most of the time will be spent in a few cities throughout England) :D

        <h2>Getting Around</h2>

        <p>One of the best things about the United Kingdom is that is has a great mode of public
            transportation. For intercity travel, you can take the trains and enjoy the scenery
            before getting off at your destination. For intracity travel, buses and subways are a
            great option, although I found the places I wanted to visit close enough to each other
            to simply spend an additional few minutes just walking around.
        </p>

        <p>That being said, my main method of transportation between the cities was by train.
            Once I was in each city, I generally walked around; however, for slightly longer
            distances or when I was too tired, I took the bus/subway.
        </p>

        <h4>Buses/Subways</h4>
            
        <p>What makes the public transportation system so convenient and accessible is that it is
            relatively easy to navigate with Google Maps. Additionally, all fares can be paid with
            a contactless card, so there is no need to purchase cards for transportation like the
            Oyster card. Mobile payments are also a viable option, but I personally chose the card
            method.
        </p>

        <p>For the buses, some cities just took a standard fare no matter how many stops you were
            passing. In other areas, you have to tell the driver the exact stop name you plan on
            getting off at so that they can charge you the appropriate amount. They will then print
            out a paper ticket for you to take.
        </p>

        <p>While I think that this is the case for most bus systems nowadays, just in case you
            aren't familiar with how to get off at your stop, be sure to press the "STOP" button
            that can be found near your seat (usually on a vertical handrail or by the window). If
            you do not press the button and no one else is getting off at your stop, the driver will
            not stop (unless there are passengers wanting to get onto the bus). In other words, the
            bus will only stop if the button has been pressed by you or another passenger.
