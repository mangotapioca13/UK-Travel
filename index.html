        <div class="text" id="getting-around">
            <h2>Getting Around</h2>

            <p>One of the best things about the United Kingdom is that is has a great mode of public
                transportation. For intercity travel, you can take the trains and enjoy the scenery
                before getting off at your destination. For intracity travel, buses and subways are a
                great option, although I found the places I wanted to visit close enough to each other
                to simply spend an additional few minutes just walking around.
            </p>

            <p>That being said, my main method of transportation between the cities was by train.
                Once I was in each city, I generally walked around; however, for slightly longer
                distances or when I was too tired, I took the bus/subway.
            </p>

            <h4>Buses/Subways</h4>
                
            <p>What makes the public transportation system so convenient and accessible is that it is
                relatively easy to navigate with Google Maps. Additionally, all fares can be paid with
                a <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/how-to-pay-and-where-to-buy-tickets-and-oyster/pay-as-you-go/contactless-and-mobile-pay-as-you-go"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contactless</a> card, so there is no need to
                purchase cards for transportation like the Oyster card. Mobile payments are also a viable
                option, but I personally chose the card method.
            </p>

            <p>For the buses, some cities just took a standard fare no matter how many stops you were
                passing. In other areas, you have to tell the driver the exact stop name you plan on
                getting off at so that they can charge you the appropriate amount. They will then print
                out a paper ticket for you to take.
            </p>

            <p>While I think that this is the case for most bus systems nowadays, just in case you
                aren't familiar with how to get off at your stop, be sure to press the "STOP" button
                that can be found near your seat (usually on a vertical handrail or by the window). If
                you do not press the button and no one else is getting off at your stop, the driver will
                not stop (unless there are passengers wanting to get onto the bus). In other words, the
                bus will only stop if the button has been pressed by you or another passenger.
            </p>

            <h4>Trains + Railcard</h4>
            
            <p>Let's move on to trains. While I was planning my trip, I came across various options for
                travel by train. There were rail passes, railcards, and also the choice to simply purchase
                the tickets individually (without any pass or card). I initially planned on purchasing a
                rail pass since there were varying durations (3 days, 7 days, 10 days, etc) for how long
                I could use the pass. As long I used the pass in its designated time frame, I could have
                unlimited rides within the appropriate regions - there are passes such as Eurail (travel
                throughout Europe) and BritRail (travel throughout the UK). However, based on the areas
                that I wanted to tour, the passes did not seem like the best option.
            </p>

            <p>This now brings me to the railcard option. Depending on your travel situation, one of
                these cards may apply to you and save you some money when purchasing train tickets. Since
                I was travelling with one other person, I bought the Two Together Railcard (this railcard
                requires that both people purchase the same train ticket). There are plenty of other cards
                available such as those aged 16-25, family/friends traveling together, etc.
            </p>

            <p>You can make the purchase online and either get a physical railcard or a mobile one. For
                the mobile card, you'll just have to download the Railcard app (there are instructions
                in the follow-up email) and add the card information. When you go on to choose and
                purchase your train tickets, be sure to indicate that you have a railcard so that the
                discounts can apply.
            </p>

            <p>Once you are on the actual train, be sure to have your ticket and railcard ready. There
                will be an employee that will ask each passenger for their ticket. If you have a railcard,
                you will also present them with that.
            </p>

            <p>If a railcard does not apply to you, you may have to just buy the tickets at their listed
                price unless there is another discount applicable.
            </p>

            <p>Tip: Look out for off-peak times on your ticket because you can save quite a bit of
                money from there.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="text" id="where-to-stay">
            <h2>Where to Stay</h2>

            <p>Whenever I could, I tried to stay in an AirBnb. Not only do you get to stay in a local
                home and experience some community vibes, you can also talk with your host and get any
                tips for where to travel/eat. Of course, you can just meet your host and get a run-down
                of your surroundings and not have to make additional small talk - to each their own.
            </p>

            <p>I generally tried to get homes that were still relatively close to the city center to
                keep transportation fees to a minimum. Thankfully, things are mostly within walking
                distance so this wasn't too much of a problem. The only times I didn't get an AirBnb
                was when the prices weren't worth the potential experience compared to hotels, or when
                there were none that were close to the areas I wanted to go to.
            </p>

            <p>One of the locations I booked a hotel at (it was actually an aparthotel - studio apartment
                + hotel) was in Manchester, England. The <a href="https://www.lockeliving.com/en/manchester/"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whitworth Locke</a> is very convenient in terms of
                location, and is only a 10 minute walk from the train station. I definitely recommend this
                place if you are looking for somewhere to stay as the facilities are great, and there is
                plenty to do nearby. If you are into the nightlife and enjoy going to bars, you will enjoy
                this place immensely. Even though the hotel is right across the street from a strip of bars,
                I didn't have a problem with any noise.
            </p>

            <p>The Whitworth Locke was also extremely flexible with my booking. I had made a mistake on the
                days I wanted to stay in Manchester, and didn't realize until the afternoon before my check-in.
                I called their number to try and see if they had room for the dates I actually wanted. They
                were understanding and fortunately were able to give me a room for the appropriate days with
                no additional cost.
            </p>

            <p>The other stop I booked a hotel for was in Cardiff, Wales. The location of this Holiday Inn
                could not have been better. It was right across the street from a beautiful park and a few minutes
                walk from the castle. Nearby were plenty of shops and arcades to explore, and it was also only around
                10 minutes away from the train station.
